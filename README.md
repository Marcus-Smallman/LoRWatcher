# Overview

The LoR Watcher is a downloadable Windows application that tracks your Legends of Runeterra games. The games can be viewed in the browser at 'http://lor.watcher'
which the LoR Watcher application hosts.

# Install
To install, go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Marcus-Smallman/LoRWatcher/releases) page and click on the latest release.
You should then be able to click on the Installer executable (*e.g. LoR.Watcher.Installer.0.1.6.exe*).
The installer should then begin downloading.

Once downloaded, run the installer. This installer will take a few minutes to finish as it has to download the LoR assets.

Upon a successful install, you should now be able to run the LoR Watcher and access the UI to view your match history at 'http://lor.watcher'.

> **NOTE**: This application does not currently retrieve any data from your Riot Games account. Therefore it will only store and retrieve games it has gathered.

## Tray Icon
There is also a useful tray icon that will appear to show that you have it running.  
If you right click on the tray Icon, the following information/options appear:
 - The version of the LoR Watcher you have installed
 - The state of the LoR game client (*e.g. **Offline** if you do not currently have the game client running,
 **Menus** If you have the game client running but are not playing a game
and **In Progress** if you are currently playing a match*)
 - A quick link to the UI in the browser (http://lor.watcher)
 - An option to modify some settings
 - An option to exit the LoR Watcher
